👨‍👩‍👧 Learning to parent while parenting my lovely daughter.

🤖 Working on DMP & CDP projects as a Senior Solution Consultant at Plan.Net. Building a team.

💻 Fine-tuning the css stylesheet of my blog. Trying to find a serif font that I want to use for italics.

🖼 Trying out generative art after reading [this essay of Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2019/code-goes-in-art-comes-out). Maybe it will become a new hobby of mine---but I need to refresh my Geometry skills for it. At least it helps me to level up my JavaScript, SVG and Canvas skills.

🎶 Practicing [Cahir's Kitchen](https://thesession.org/tunes/1090) song on my low D [tin whistle](/tunes/).

🐉 Playing Dungeons & Dragons 5e both as a Halfling Calligrapher Warlock called Nim Inkwell 🧙🏻 and a Tabaxi Barbarian called Ban K'nurr an Tauira 😸. I am also a Dungeon Master in a custom campaign that plays in the beautiful and peaceful region around Sí Bheg, Sí Mhor when suddenly a dark ancient cult arises. Currently, I am playing online due to COVID restrictions.

💪 Testing the minimalist Calisthenics program by [Kyle Boggeman](https://www.kboges.com/).
