## Tech

I build this site using [Lume](https://lume.land) Its a general-purpose static site generator, like Jekyll and Eleventy, but itâ€™s faster, simpler and easier to use and configure, besides being super flexible.

Frontend components are build with Plain CSS and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
