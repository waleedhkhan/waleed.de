> Technology is best when it brings people together.
> --Matt Mullenweg (Businessman)

<figcaption>

My favourite type of technology brings people together. Music, cinemas, phones, chats, games, transportation, web community, etc pp. But I like to use this quote in a different context. I like it when people come together to create technology as a team. It is fascinating to see how teams of different professions can come up with solutions that one person alone could never imagine. I therefore believe in a very agile process when it comes to developing technology. Only when we involve designers, scientists, engineers, businessmen, customers, etc. we can come up with a solution that truly succeeds.

> Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.
> --Pablo Picasso (Artist)

<figcaption>

We tend to try to solve everything with technology. But technology can only do what we engineers and users feed into it. It is important to think outside of the box when it comes to creating innovative solutions. [Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/pablo_picasso_102018)

> Build half a product, not a half-ass product.
> --Basecamp

<figcaption>

What a beautiful approach to product development. I have experienced many cases where products were not shaped to solve one problem well. These products were adjusted to meet every feature the sales team required to sell the product to clients. Unfortunately this leads to very hard to maintain and document products (I like to call them feature kraken). In my humble opinion the optimal way is somewhere between.

> We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment.
> --Gaston Bachelard (Philosopher)

<figcaption>

Great quote that reminds me of the importance to never complain and always try to improve. The stakes are high that everything is disappointing if we do not make it interesting for ourself.
