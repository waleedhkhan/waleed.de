## Experience
Professionally, I have held technology & business leadership positions serving a variety of industries across Europe.

As a consultant, I have been working directly with organisations to build clear, coherent and scalable products. My work is recognized by several large organizations, including eBay, PayPal and Adobe, among others.

As for non-tech things in startups, Iâ€™ve become more and more interested in the methods of leading teams and how to work smarter. That is, how the well-being of each team member is kept central while the work can progress in a smooth way.

Today I work with businesses to help them make a meaningful impact within their industry. I bring a critical eye to the development process, and advocate renewal over wholesale reinvention.
