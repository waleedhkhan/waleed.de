title: CTO Selection Service

---
For years, I've found myself on the receiving end of countless requests from friends in need of help. They're seeking the right individuals to lead their tech teams, typically CTOs or technical co-founders.

I'm not here peddling e-books or tutorial videos. Instead, what I'm offering is a slice of my time, my passion, and my dedication to the creation of sustainable digital products.

My CTO Selection Service isn't your run-of-the-mill, one-size-fits-all kind of deal. It's all about putting my experience to work for you. I'll provide you with the insights and assessments that'll steer you towards the perfect fit for your tech leadership roles.

Why choose me? Well, since 2018, I've had my share of hits and misses in the startup scene and managed to build successful E-Commerce Accelerator teams for Mittelstand (SMEs) in Berlin. Over the past decade, I've handpicked over 200 tech role candidates for startups and SMEs in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the USA. I've been in the trenches and know the ropes, so I'm uniquely positioned to help you find your next star player.

What's the offer: 
1) Consultation with Founders or CEO to understand your product and requirements.

2) I will review 3 candidates and i expect you already have your first few rounds with them.

4) 1:1s with Candidates (Remotely if you are not based Berlin.) 

5) Feedback round after the screening 

About Pricing:
A typical CTO hiring process can span 6-12 months and rack up to 200K in recruiting expenses if you're lucky. My primary goal is to streamline this process, fostering a smooth connection between founders and candidates to expedite decision-making, save precious time, and preserve energy.

I'm still exploring the best pricing model for this service. However, I anticipate letting the market dictate the value of this service, ranging between 5-10kâ‚¬ per selection.
