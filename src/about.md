I was born in 1988 in Karachi, a city of 200 million people in Pakistan. I played a lot of cricket growing up and did my early schooling there.

In 2005, I got my first paid gig to build a large web portfolio for a film production company. They need a backend manage a large amount of video content and showcase it on their website. As the only developer, I used Joomla as CMS and had to learn it fast while improving my programing skills.

Dealing with large open source codebase like Joomla was a pain, but it gave me a lot of insights on how to navigate around complexity and focus on outcome without knowing every single bit about the system.In April 2008, I started experimenting with Magento, which changed everything. It was one of the most sophisticated and over engineered shop system build to date. 

To be honest, it was painful to learn and operate Magento in the beta phase. But it solved a tons business problems in e-commerce. Within a few years, most e-commerce companies in Europe started adopting it, and suddenly I had an endless amount of projects. I was building shops, marketplaces, pos-systems, data warehouses, erp connector. I got to learn a lot in a short period and it also enabled me to travel around Europe on projects and meet tons of new people excited about building their new startups or scaling their current online business.
