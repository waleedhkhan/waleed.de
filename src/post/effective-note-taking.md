Writing things down is the best thing you can do for your sanity and avoid burnout. When we write something down, we are actively engaging with the information, which helps to solidify it in our minds. Additionally, when we have written notes to refer back to, it becomes much easier to recall the information later on.

We all have different ways of organising information and structuring them into writing. There is no one-size fits all and that’s why productivity industry has been booming in recent years. Trying to sell you the latest and greatest tool and lock you into their ecosystem.
<br><br>
I’ve tired most of the popular tools and systems in recent years, like notion, roam research, zettelkasten, GTD but I always come back the same good old system I have been using for a long time.

Sometimes keeping things simple and accessible is the best option.
