I was bit busy last year [because of work](https://youtu.be/qd4T-sP1EsY) and prolonged COVID illness at the end of the year. After taking time off work I finally gathered enough energy to rethink my website. 
<br><br>
Reading [lot of blogs](https://ooh.directory) inspired me to rebuild my personal website into a slowly growing digital garden.

{% sidenote 1 %}
  The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.”

Stay tuned!

Happy New Year 🎆
