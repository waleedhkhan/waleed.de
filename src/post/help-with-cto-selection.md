  Guiding You in Selecting Your Ideal CTO or Technical Co-Founder

For years, I've found myself on the receiving end of countless requests from friends in need of help. They're seeking the right individuals to lead their tech teams, typically CTOs or technical co-founders.
<br><br>
I'm not here peddling e-books or tutorial videos. Instead, what I'm offering is a slice of my time, my passion, and my dedication to the creation of sustainable digital products.
<br><br>
My service isn't your run-of-the-mill, one-size-fits-all kind of deal. It's all about putting my experience to work for you. I'll provide you with the insights and assessments that'll steer you towards the perfect fit for your tech leadership roles.
<br><br>
Why choose me? Well, since 2010, I've had my share of hits and misses in the startup scene and managed to build successful E-Commerce Accelerator teams for Mittelstand (SMEs) in Berlin. Over the past decade, I've handpicked over 200 tech role candidates for startups and SMEs in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the USA. I've been in the trenches and know the ropes, so I'm uniquely positioned to help you find your next star player.

<br><br>
**What's the offer:** 
- I'll have a detailed chat with the Founders or CEO to understand your product and needs.
- I'll review 3 of your candidates, provided you've done your initial rounds with them.
- I'll have in-depth 1:1s with your candidates (if you're not in Berlin, we can do it remotely).
- We'll have a feedback session post-screening to discuss my observations and recommendations.
<br><br>

**Pricing:**
<br>
A typical CTO hiring process can span 6-12 months and rack up to 100K in recruiting expenses if you're lucky. My primary goal is to streamline this process, fostering a smooth connection between founders and candidates to expedite decision-making, save precious time, and preserve energy.
<br><br>

I'm still exploring the best pricing model for this service. However, I anticipate letting the market decide the value of this service, ranging between 5-10kâ‚¬.
