I somtimes invest in early-stage technology startups, mostly via €30K-€50K checks. I’ll look at anything, but especially B2B SaaS, e-commerce, future of work, video, and developer tools.


## Basic requirement

1)Your business model is not depended on Google Ads
2)You love to code or design and build an early version of the product yourself
3)You have a deep understanding of the space you are in 

### Investing process
_Step 1_: I need a deck, but a product I can play with is even better.
_Step 2_: Zoom meeting (30min or so)
_Step 3_: Asynchronous due diligence

That’s it! You’ll most likely hear back in less than 48 hours if it’s an easy yes, sometimes a bit longer.

## After investing
Honestly, most investors don't do much. It's mostly the money and how it looks for other investors, prospective candidates, and potential customers. That said, I can:

- Answer any questions you have (things I like helping)
- Give you access to a bunch of alive documents
- Get you $100,000 in AWS credits
- Get out of your way!##

## I love helping with
- High-fidelity product design und development and high-level product strategy
- Launch/marketing/distribution strategy
- Does not help with: sourcing candidates

### Top recommendations for founders
Startups succeed as long as they don't fail. How not to fail:

>Don't die. Always have enough money in the bank to keep going. From my experience, the startups that don't go out of business within the first couple years end up doing quite well.

>Read! Get to know your space intimately, and learn from the mistakes of other business-builders

>Hire really well. A killer team, working on a post-product market-fit company, with enough money in the bank, enabled by highly-leveraged software will likely succeed.

>Reach product-market fit. I don't subscribe to any frameworks for this. The easiest way to know if you're here is if you stop asking if you're here. The second easiest way is if you are growing at a very consistent, compounding rate (e.g. 20% month over month).
