  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="measure">
    Professionally, I have held technology & business leadership positions serving a variety of industries across Europe.

As a consultant, I have been working directly with organisations to build clear, coherent and scalable products. My work is recognized by several large organizations, including eBay, PayPal and Adobe, among others.

  <p class="measure">   
    In recent years Iâ€™ve become more and more interested in the methods of leading teams and how to work smarter. That is, how the well-being of each team member is kept central while the work can progress in a smooth way.
    
   Today I work with businesses to help them make a meaningful impact within their industry. I bring a critical eye to the development process, and advocate renewal over wholesale reinvention.
