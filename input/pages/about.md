My name is Waleed, and I’m a Software Engineer based in Berlin.
Professionally, I have held technology & business leadership positions serving a variety of industries across Europe.
As a consultant, I have been working directly with organisations to build clear, coherent strategy deliver and scalable products. My work is acknowledged by several organizations, including eBay, PayPal and Adobe, among others.

As for non-tech things in startups, I’ve become more and more interested in the methods of leading teams and how to work smarter. That is, how the well-being of each team member is kept central while the work can progress in a smooth way.

Today I work with businesses to help them make a meaningful impact within their industry. I bring a critical eye to the development process and advocate renewal over wholesale reinvention.

Here's what is going on [right now](/now/).

## Where to find me

- The best way to contact me is via email at `hello@waleed.de`.
- I store all my public code on [GitHub](https://github.com/waleedhkhan) and find myself on there quite a bit. I open source everything that’s not proprietary or for sale.
- I keep my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waleedhk/) mostly up-to-date so that serves as my resume for now.
- I am "on Twitter" [@askwaleedkhan](https://twitter.com/askwaleedkhan).
