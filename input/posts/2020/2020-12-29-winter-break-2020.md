{% bigtext %}This winter break was pretty uneventful because of COVID lockdown in Germany. I spent lot of reading and working mini-projects at home with my wife and playing with our cat. Everyone copes with a crisis differently. I found taking walks, getting fresh air and taking pictures of nature helped.{% endbigtext %}

## Books

 - [How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book) I hoped it would teach me how to read faster. Instead it teaches you to read slower, analytically. It also teaches you how to "date" a book to decide if you really want to spend the time to read the whole thing before committing yourself to it. 
This book has a rather pedantic tone, which makes it a little dry to plow through. But I kept at it because there were philosophical gems interspersed throughout the pages.

- [Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48930266-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain) Renowned neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett demystify how brain works. In seven short essays (plus a bite-sized story about how brains evolved), this slim, entertaining, and accessible collection reveals mind-expanding lessons from the front lines of neuroscience research.
