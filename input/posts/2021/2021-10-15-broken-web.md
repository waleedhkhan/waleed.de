A bombardment of overlays and pop-ups are currently screaming for our attention for purposes of marketing and legal requirements (GDPR). We have become overwhelmed with interruptions, whether cookie banners, newsletter subscription prompts, feedback requests, chatbot bubbles, dynamic ad blocks, or notification alerts. Web pages have become possessed, and we need a fucking exorcist to come to our collective aid. Now, that might come in the form of ad and pop-up blockers, which go a long way to remedy the UX horrorshow, but it’s a bit like locking your front door to prevent raving zombies from entering your home rather than living in a calm, frictionless, and uninterrupted environment by design. And that’s what we want—at least theoretically.


I recently discovered a website that brilliantly shows the state of user experience (UX) design on today’s web. Take a moment to use it and see for yourself how fundamentally broken and intrusive web browsing has become on the majority of websites we interact with daily.
